# Supreme-Pancake
Based on running the mergesort algorithm on many arrays of different lengths, and measuring the time it took in milliseconds, average run times were synthesized. 
Using this data, a graph was plotted to represent it visually. The link is here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nJfYaayP-T9ycAJQCTNdA-V1wZZR--OjntgAycNBkzo/edit?usp=sharing
The data we've acquired is as follows (in the data table other graphs are for reference):

 As seen in the image, the run time of merge sort increases at a slower rate than y = n, but appears to be linear.
