Based on running the mergesort algorithm on many arrays of different lengths, and measuring the time it took in milliseconds, average run times were synthesized. 
Using this data, a graph was plotted to represent it visually. The link is here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nJfYaayP-T9ycAJQCTNdA-V1wZZR--OjntgAycNBkzo/edit?usp=sharing
The data we've acquired is as follows (in the data table other graphs are for reference):

 As seen in the image, the run time of merge sort appears to be linear but when lookin closely and in particulr zooming into the smaller ranges one can see that the runtime of merge sort is O(nlog(n)). By playing with the coefficients of y = nlog(n), it becomes more clear that this is, in fact, corresponds to the data gathered.
